# PutsDebug

This simple gem adds method pd() to Ruby that helps with puts debugging. 
I found myself copying this method from project to project that is why I decided to move it to gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'puts_debug'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install puts_debug

## Usage

Adds method pd (Puts Debugging) to Ruby. Defined in Kernel module which is included into Object class so this method
is accessible from everywhere. Output is sent to standard error stream (stderr) so it could be further separated
from standard output like this:

  
    $ rails s 2>> error

then you can

  
    $ tail -f error
  
 to watch error stream output.
 
 Usage examples: 
  
```ruby 

# Method signature: 

def pd(h = {}, line_symbol = nil, show_lines = :both, empty_lines_margin = nil)
  # ...
end  


pd('something') # => 
something       
   
pd({name: 'Yogurt', calories: 200}) # =>
name: Yogurt
calories: 200
  
  
pd(1, '-', :both, 1) #=>
  
------------------------------------------------------------
1
------------------------------------------------------------
  
pd({a: 1, b: 3}, '*', :both, 2) #=>
 

************************************************************
a: 1
b: 3
************************************************************


pd({a: 1, b: 3}, '=', :top, 1)
pd('In the midlle')
pd({c:2, d: 33}, '=', :bottom, 1)  
#=>

============================================================
a: 1
b: 3
In the midlle
c: 2
d: 33
============================================================

```
